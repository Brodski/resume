</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Independently migrated legacy monolithic endpoints to AWS, redesigning them into microservice-like architectures and implementing IaC and CI/CD pipelines with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD, reducing infrastructure costs and improving scalability.</li>
<li>Migrated legacy Adobe cloud endpoints to AWS, designing and implementing the architecture, IaC, and CI/CD pipelines end-to-end, reducing infrastructure costs and improving scalability, using Terraform and GitLab actions.</li>
<li>Containerized applications with Docker for deployment across Adobe and AWS environments, standardizing deployments and streamlining operations.</li>
<li>Developed AWS Lambda endpoints (Node.js) that have maintained 100% uptime since deployment, ensuring reliability for core business functions.</li>
<li>Developed AWS Lambda functions (Node.js) exposed via API Gateway that ran in production for 6+ months without interruption, supporting core business functions.</li>
<li>Built a caching layer for user sessions using AWS ElastiCache (Redis), reducing database load and improving response times, in collaboration with the Salesforce authentication engineers.</li>
<li>Developed an indexing system in MySQL, deployed in AWS RDS, to catalog assets stored in S3, to enable the web content team to quickly search and manage files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Backend Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rewrote a login flow with Spring Boot, ensuring end to end encryption, delegating credential validation to an external authentication server for centralized security.</li>
<li>Built a developer-facing API platform with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation, enabling internal teams to adopt standardized endpoints sharing features  across products.</li>
<li>Engineered automated backend jobs for content crawling, bulk edits, data validation, and system monitoring - reducing manual workload and improving data integrity using a combination of Spring Boot and our legacy Sling Servlet.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented services leveraging OpenAI&#39;s API (LLMs) to personalize website content, with optimizations such as request batching, response caching, and fallback handling to ensure efficiency and reliability at scale.</li>
<li>Developed Java servlets to dynamically generate HTML pages and interact with databases (SQL), enabling seamless content rendering and reliable data exchange.</li>
<li>Developed RESTful Spring Boot services with a MySQL databases to support content management and deliver dynamic data.</li>
<li>Implemented multithreading and asynchronous workflows with Java (thread pools, futures).</li>
