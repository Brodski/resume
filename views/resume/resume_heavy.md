**WORK HISTORY**  
**Senior Java Web Developer**, at Ping Identity  
*Sept 2020 - June 2024*
  - **Overview:** 
    - Built and maintained Ping Identity's public website (www.pingidentity.com), using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), designing UI components, templates, and backend services for a scalable, content-driven platform.  
    - Engineered cloud-native backend solutions using AWS services (e.g. Lambda, S3, API Gateway), extending the content-platform's capabilities and performance. 

  - **Cloud Infrastructure:**
    - Independently migrated legacy monolithic endpoints to AWS, redesigning them into microservice-like architectures and implementing IaC and CI/CD pipelines with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD, reducing infrastructure costs and improving scalability.
    - Migrated legacy Adobe cloud endpoints to AWS, designing and implementing the architecture, IaC, and CI/CD pipelines end-to-end, reducing infrastructure costs and improving scalability, using Terraform and GitLab actions.
    - Containerized applications with Docker for deployment across Adobe and AWS environments, standardizing deployments and streamlining operations.
    - Developed AWS Lambda endpoints (Node.js) that have maintained 100% uptime since deployment, ensuring reliability for core business functions.
    - Developed AWS Lambda functions (Node.js) exposed via API Gateway that ran in production for 6+ months without interruption, supporting core business functions.
    - Built a caching layer for user sessions using AWS ElastiCache (Redis), reducing database load and improving response times, in collaboration with the Salesforce authentication engineers.
    - Developed an indexing system in MySQL, deployed in AWS RDS, to catalog assets stored in S3, to enable the web content team to quickly search and manage files.

  - **Backend Development:**
    - Rewrote a login flow with Spring Boot, ensuring end to end encryption, delegating credential validation to an external authentication server for centralized security.
    - Built a developer-facing API platform with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation, enabling internal teams to adopt standardized endpoints sharing features  across products.
    - Engineered automated backend jobs for content crawling, bulk edits, data validation, and system monitoring - reducing manual workload and improving data integrity using a combination of Spring Boot and our legacy Sling Servlet.
    - Designed and implemented services leveraging OpenAI's API (LLMs) to personalize website content, with optimizations such as request batching, response caching, and fallback handling to ensure efficiency and reliability at scale.
    - Developed Java servlets to dynamically generate HTML pages and interact with databases (SQL), enabling seamless content rendering and reliable data exchange.
    - Developed RESTful Spring Boot services with a MySQL databases to support content management and deliver dynamic data.
    - Implemented multithreading and asynchronous workflows with Java (thread pools, futures).
    - Implemented multithreading and asynchronous workflows with Java (thread pools, futures).
    - Configured and debugged Maven builds, including module dependency management and resolving complex dependency conflicts.

  - **Frontend work:** 
    - Developed modular, reusable UI components with React and JSP for enterprise applications, supporting dynamic content rendering, localization, and API-driven interactions.
    - Frequent updates to frontend development workflow by configuring CI/CD pipelines, automating testing, and optimizing builds with Webpack and Gulp.js.
    - Working knowledge of asset optimization, cache busting (CDN & client-side), Google Tag Manager, preloading strategies, service workers, accessiblity, and performance profiling.
  - **Frontend Development:**
    - Built modular, reusable UI components with React and JSP for enterprise applications, enabling dynamic content rendering, localization, and seamless API-driven interactions.
    - Migrated legacy JSP views to Next.js/React based components, improving consistency and reducing UI-related issues.
    - Enhanced frontend development workflows by configuring CI/CD pipelines, automating testing with Jest, and optimizing builds with Webpack and Gulp.js.
    - Implemented asset optimization and performance strategies (cache busting, CDN delivery, preloading, service workers), ensured web accessibility compliance (WCAG / ADA), and integrated Google Tag Manager to improve site performance and user experience.
    - Delivered accessibility improvements

  - **Soft skills** Mentored new employees and interns, facilitating their success, providing technical guidance onboarding and integration into the organization.

**Platform Infrastructure Integration / Automation Engineer**, at Charter Communications  
*Dec 2018 - Oct 2019*
  - **Overview:**
    - Part of a DevOps/SRE team, contributing to deployment processes and quality assurance.
  - **Job Duties:**
    - Routinely accessed virtual machines (VMs) via SSH to execute and develop various scripts. Used command-line tools to navigate the internal file system of the VMs to locate log files, view, filter, and analyze logs for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
    - Developed a Flask/Python-based proxy server to streamline traffic and facilitate data retrieval from a MongoDB database. Added frontend framework with React. 
    - Wrote a Python-based testing tool for quality assurance on a DHCP server cluster, utilizing the hypervisor's API for precise control over both worker and master virtual machines during stress testing.
    - Deployed docker apps, running Telegraf, to gather metrics from the VMs running the DHCP servers. It streamed data into our Splunk server for real-time data analysis. I also created a Splunk dashboard to visualize and examine the data.
    - Helped build a new test environment for an existing project in AWS by redeploying that project at a scaled-down cluster size. This involved researching company documents and working with the team that managed that project; editing configuration files like Terraform, then executing the deployment.
