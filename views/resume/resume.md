**WORK HISTORY**  
**Senior Web Developer**, at Ping Identity  
*Sept 2020 - June 2024*
  - **Summary:** 
    - Built and maintained Ping Identity's public website (www.pingidentity.com) using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), designing UI components, templates, and backend services for a scalable, content-driven platform.  
    - Engineered cloud-native backend solutions using AWS services, extending the platform's capabilities and performance. 
  - **Cloud Infrastructure:**
    - Re-architected select endpoints from a monolithic application into AWS as microservices to reduce infrastructure costs and improve scalability, implementing IaC and CI/CD with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD.
    - Reduced database load and improved response times by designing and building a caching layer for user sessions with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
    - Containerized applications with Docker for deployment across Adobe and AWS environments, standardizing deployments and streamlining operations.
    - Developed AWS Lambda functions (Node.js) exposed via API Gateway that ran in production without interruption, supporting core business functions.
  - **Backend:**
    - Designed services that used LLMs (via OpenAI's API) to personalize website content, ensuring API efficiency and reliability through batching, caching, and fallbacks.
    - Built a developer-facing API platform with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation, standardizing endpoints and enabling multiple teams to integrate consistently across products.
    - Rewrote the login flow in Spring Boot, addressing security vulnerabilities and implementing centralized authentication with an external server.
    - Automated large-scale content operations (crawling, bulk edits, validation), reducing manual workload and improving data integrity.
  - **Frontend:**
    - Modernized JSP-based views by replacing legacy vanilla JS/HTML with React, creating modular, reusable UI components that improved maintainability, accelerated development, and supported API-driven interfaces.
    - Enhanced frontend development workflows by configuring CI/CD pipelines, automating testing with Jest, and optimizing builds with Webpack and Gulp.js, reducing deployment time.
    - Implemented asset optimization and performance strategies (cache busting, CDN delivery, preloading, service workers) and ensured web accessibility compliance (WCAG/ADA) to improve site performance and user experience.
  - **Soft Skills:** Mentored a new employee and an intern (later hired full-time), providing technical guidance for onboarding and integration into the organization.

**Platform Infrastructure Integration / Automation Engineer**, at Charter Communications  
*Dec 2018 - Oct 2019*
  - **Summary:**
    - Part of a DevOps/SRE team focused on automation, infrastructure, and QA across containerized and virtualized environments (Kubernetes, Docker, VMware vSphere).
  - **Job Duties:**
    - Built a Flask/Python proxy service to route requests and retrieve data from MongoDB; developed a React-based frontend interface for visualization and interaction.
    - Wrote a Python-based testing tool for quality assurance on a Kubernetes cluster, using the kubectl CLI and the hypervisor's API.
    - Deployed containerized applications with Docker and Telegraf to collect metrics from Kubernetes clusters for system monitoring.
    - Deployed a scaled-down test environment by modifying Terraform configs and collaborating with project owners to redeploy services for QA.
